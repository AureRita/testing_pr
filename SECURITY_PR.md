# How to test a security pull request

As we know, Security Pull requests are hidden on PrestaShop/PrestaShop repository, So it's hard to launch Automatic tests on it.
For this purpose, we did create a new workflow called [Testing Security PrestaShop pull requests (without cache)](./.github/workflows/pr_security_test_one.yml).

## Pre-requisites

### Create a private repository of `PrestaShop/ga.test.ui.pr`

Before you start testing you need to make sure that **NO ACCESS ARE GRANTED** on where you test, and since you can make a fork of public repository private (Github policy), you need to create a new private one, following these steps :

1. Go to your Profile -> Repositories then click on <kbd style="background-color: green">**New**</kbd>

2. Add a name and Make it **PRIVATE**

3. Then Create The Repository

4. Once created, click on <kbd style="background-color: #373e47">**Import Code**</kbd> below page

5. Add Link to [PrestaShop/ga.test.ui.pr](https://github.com/prestashop/ga.tests.ui.pr) and click on <kbd style="background-color: green">**Begin import**</kbd>

6. Congrats, your Repository is Ready.

### Activate Actions on the new Repository

When a new private Repository is created with Import, Actions are disabled, you should enable it, To do that, you have to :

1. Go To Your Repository -> Setting -> Actions General

2. Check `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`

3. Click on <kbd style="background-color: #373e47">**Save**</kbd>

4. Congrats, Actions are available now

### Create A personal Token

A token will serve to access the private repository of the pull request, you can refer to this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to do so.
You need to only check this part on the setting

Copy Your token and **Keep it safe**

PS: You can set the expiration date to the minimum (7 days) so it can not be used a lot.

## Start Your Test

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, You can now test the security pull request.

## How to use it ?

## Cleaning up behind

After finishing the tests, when you finally validate the pull request(s), you should clean behind by:

- [Deleting the private repository you created](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)
- [Deleting the access Token you created](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#deleting-a-personal-access-token)
